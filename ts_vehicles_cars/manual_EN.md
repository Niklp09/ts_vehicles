# Vehicles: Cars

Cars can be used to transport players and goods over long distances on even terrain.

## Construction

First of all, you have to place a car construction stand.
You can then add parts to your car by right-clicking it with them.

If you try to enter the car (by right-clicking it), a chat message will appear with information about what parts are still missing.

The car's form can be opened with shift + right-click on the car.

Many types of parts (e.g. chassis, seats, interior etc.) can be colored in the crafting grid.

For destruction, empty the storage rooms and the tank, remove all parts and then pick the car construction stand up by left-clicking it.

## Control

You can enter and leave the car by right-clicking it.
The vehicle can be controlled by the WASD keys.
For breaking, press space.

### Lights

The lights can be toggled with the following key combinations:

Shift + W: Front lights
Shift + A: Direction indicator (left)
Shift + D: Direction indicator (right)
Shift + A + D: Warning lights
Shift + W + S: Special lights (if installed)

The reversing lights will automatically turn on when driving backwards.

## Storage

By left-clicking the car with an item, you can add it to the storage room quickly and easily.
The storage room can be accessed via the car's form (use shift + right-click to open it).

## Fuel

Cars can use gasoline, hydrogen or electricity as power sources.

### Stations

Fuelling stations have to be connected to the respective network (gasoline, hydrogen or electricity) on the bottom side.
In case of gasoline and hydrogen, a pump is necessary.

For fuelling operations, the car has to be placed in such way that there is no obstacle and a maximum distance of 3 meters between the station and the fuel tank cap (on the back of the passenger's side).
You can then connect the hose by opening the station's form and choosing the desired car.

### Emergency fuelling

You can use gasoline canisters or barrels, hydrogen cylinders and batteries ("TA3 Accu Box") to refuel your cars if no station is available.

## Passengers

A car can have up to 3 passengers in addition to the driver.
Just enter the car after the driver.

You can choose if you want to open the car for everyone as a passenger or if only owners should be allowed as passengers.
